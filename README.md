# LoopingThread

A LoopingThread can be used to:
- Repetitively do the same task (the *tick*)
- Allow for additional tasks (*callbacks*) to be scheduled for execution

# Use for main threads
The idea is very simple and can be useful in a variety of cases, the most common one being for a main thread. In a typical graphical application you have a *main loop* that is run in the initial thread. The main loop handles a variety of tasks such as rendering a user interface, updating program logic, etc.

This works fine unless you decide to run something asynchronously, for instance loading a file. Executing such a long-lasting task in the main thread would potentially prevent any interaction with the user interface, and the interface feels *unresponsive*. Thus, things like loading files from the disk or fetching data from a remote computer should be done in a secondary thread. However, here is where a problem occurs: When the user interface starts a new thread to - for instance - load a file and passes a callback to be called as soon as the task is done, the callback will run into issues when it tries to modify the user interface to illustrate the successfully loaded file. This is due to the fact that the callback will be run in the secondary thread, although all the user interface handling is done in the main thread.

The solution to this issue is using the LoopingThread. The secondary task can simply schedule the callback to be run from the main thread, and any complications that occured due to thread safety or race conditions in the past will be gone.

# Usage

Have a look at the [main.cpp](main.cpp) file for an example with a MainThread.
